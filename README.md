Task 1 -
 #variable selection rules -
We studied the variable selection rules in python .
 #Operators -
We studied the operatos in python i.e Arithmatic , logical, assignment , identity,bitwise, membership,comparison etc .
 #data types -
 we studied different data types in python like lists,tuple, set,dictionary .
 In list we study the list methods like append, copy,reverse,pop,count,index,sort,accessing etc .
 Tuples are immutable which means values in tuple cannot be modified ,so we study the how declare the the tuples .
 In set we studied the methods like mutable , ordered etc 
  dictionary contains key value pairs as its data elements . They are mutable .
  #numbers -
 There are three types of numbers i.e numeric,float,complex .
  #strings-
In strings we studied sinle line and multi line string ,strings are written  in double  quotes.

Task 2 -
#if statement -
 if statement is used when single condition is to check like number is equal to , not equal to,greater than , smaller than etc.
#if else statement -
if ele statement is used to check the two conditions like positive negative , numeric complex etc 
#if  elif else statement -
 if elif else statement is used to check more than two conditions .
#for loop -
for loop is used to execute the code in certain number of times over a range or a sequence .
#while loop -
while loop is used to execute the code in certain number of times over a particular condition ,while loop continues untill a particular condition is no longer met .

Task 3 -
In Task 3 we study Breck,pass,continuenstatement also we study User define function like statistical(mean,median,mode,variance) and logical(odd,even,grades)
#break-
Functionality: When break is encountered inside a loop, the loop stops its execution and control is transferred to the statement immediately following the loop.
Use Case: It is useful when you want to exit a loop as soon as a certain condition is met, avoiding unnecessary iterations.
#continue
Functionality: When continue is encountered, the current iteration is terminated, and the loop proceeds with the next iteration.
Use Case: It is useful when you want to skip over some parts of the loop but continue with the next iterations. For instance, you might want to skip over even
numbers or any specific condition within a loop.
#pass
Functionality: The pass statement does nothing and is used as a placeholder.
Use Case: It is useful when a statement is syntactically required, but you do not want any action to be taken. Commonly used during development as a placeholder for future code,
in empty function or class definitions, or within conditional statements where you plan to add code later.
#Statistical User-Defined Functions-
Statistical functions are essential for data analysis and help summarize and understand the data's properties.
Mean is use to Calculate the average of a list of numbers.median is use to Find the middle value of a list of numbers.mode is used to Find the most frequently occurring value(s)
in a list of numbers.Variance is used to Measure the spread of numbers in a list from the mean.Standard Deviation is used to Measure the amount of variation or dispersion of a set
of values.Percentile is used to Determine the value below which a given percentage of observations fall.range is used to Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum
values in a list.Interquartile Range (IQR) is used to Measure the middle 50% of the data.Covariance is used to Measure how two variables change together.Correlation Coefficientis used to Measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
#Logical User-Defined Functions-
#is_even-Purpose: Check if a number is even.#is_odd-Purpose: Check if a number is odd.#is_prime-Purpose: Check if a number is prime.#is_palindrome-Purpose: Check if a string is a palindrome.#is_anagram-Purpose: Check if two strings are anagrams.#is_subset-Purpose: Check if one set is a subset of another.#is_superset-Purpose: Check if one set is a superset of another.#are_disjoint-Purpose: Check if two sets are disjoint.#are_equal-Purpose: Check if two lists are equal.#is_sorted-Purpose: Check if a list is sorted.
